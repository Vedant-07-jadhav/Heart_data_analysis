# **Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates a Flask-based web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user input using a trained machine learning model. It is built as part of a data science pipeline that includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

The application uses a **Random Forest Classifier**, trained on balanced heart disease data, to predict outcomes. The model is accessible via a user-friendly web interface.

## **Features**
1. **Web Interface**:
   - Inputs patient data (e.g., age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels).
   - Predicts whether there is a risk of heart disease with results as either:
     - **No Heart Disease Detected**
     - **Heart Disease Detected — Consult a Doctor**

2. **Pipeline**:
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Handles imbalanced data using SMOTE and one-hot encodes categorical features.
   - **Model Training**: Implements a **Random Forest Classifier** with feature scaling.
   - **Model Evaluation**: Validates the model on testing data with accuracy and classification metrics.
   - **Deployed Model**: The trained model and scaler are saved and reused for predictions through Flask.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 
  - scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, xgboost, pandas, numpy, joblib.
- **Web Framework**:
  - Flask (with Jinja2 templating for the frontend).
- **Visualization**:
  - matplotlib, seaborn.
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, JavaScript (for form submission and API calls).

## **Setup Instructions**

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your system:


### **1. Install dependencies**
Ensure you have Python (version 3.13+) installed. Then install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **2. Train the model**
1. Preprocess the data using `data_preprocessing.py`:
   ```bash
   python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
   ```
2. Train the machine learning model using `model_training.py`:
   ```bash
   python scripts/model_training.py
   ```

### **3. Run the Flask application**
1. Start the Flask app to serve predictions using:
   ```bash
   python app/app.py
   ```
2. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### **4. Use the Web Interface**
- Input the required patient information into the form.
- Submit the form to get real-time predictions.
